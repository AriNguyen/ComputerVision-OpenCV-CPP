# Computer Vision with C++ OpenCV 4.0

## Overview

Yes, another Github repo to learn new stuff. I found computer vision is fun and powerful!! I'm following this book [Building Computer Vision Projects with OpenCV 4 and C++: Implement complex computer vision algorithms and explore deep learning and face detection](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Computer-Vision-Projects-OpenCV/dp/1838644679). 

It's my first time using Dockerfile with OpenCV C++. It's so much easier than installing package to my macOS environemnt though. It was really a pain in the ass guys. Highly recommend using Docker!!!!! 

Let's goo!! 

## Run program
```console
mkdir build
```

```console
cd build
```

```console
cmake ../
```

```console
make
```
