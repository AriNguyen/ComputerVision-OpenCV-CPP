## Overview

Yes, another Github repo to learn new stuff. Computer vision is fun!! I'm following the book [Building Computer Vision Projects with OpenCV 4 and C++: Implement complex computer vision algorithms and explore deep learning and face detection](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Computer-Vision-Projects-OpenCV/dp/1838644679) 

Let's goo!! 

## Run program
```console
mkdir build
```
